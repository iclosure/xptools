/*
	WED_FileCache - THEORY OF OPERATION

	The file cache is a black box: clients call WED_file_cache_request_file repeatedly on a timer, passing in a request struct, receiving a response struct.
	
	- The request contains information about the URL to connect to and other data
	- The response contains error data, download progress, and (potentially) a path where the file successfully downloaded
		* After an error a url is placed on a cool down timer, preventing WED DDOS'ing the server
		* Clients can use the error information to decide whether or not to try again
	- Cached files that are too old are re-downloaded
	- A cache domain policy determines maximum age and minimum cool down periods
